    <h1>Abdullah Al-Harbi</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>His story began when he lost a dear person in 2005 due to a lack of blood.
    
    He needed to think about this situation, and he kept looking into donating blood and why Saudi Arabia needs more than any other country to donate blood, and he found that the cause is traffic accidents.
   
    He did not stop thinking about it only, but formed a campaign  Inside Aramco, and then he expanded his campaign outside the walls of his company in 2012, so his idea was to “shop and donate” the first center in a shopping mall to donate blood,
    benefiting more than one hundred thousand people from this work.
